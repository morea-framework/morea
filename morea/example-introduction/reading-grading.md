# Grading

Your grade in this class will be based upon the following graded assignments:

  * Technical writing. Your writings will account for a minimum of 20% of your grade. This will include technical articles published in your blog, your professional persona, and software documentation you produce as part of your projects.

  * Code and other technical artifacts. Your code, tests, github repositories, etc. will account for a minimum of 20% of your grade.

  * Final project. A minimum of 20% of your grade will be based upon the final project.

  * WODs. Approximately once a week, part of the class will be spent doing a "workout of the day", or WOD. These will account for a significant percentage of your grade, but I have no “minimum” percentage for them.

Each graded assignment is worth some number of points, and I strive to review and grade all assignments within a week of their due date. Your cumulative number of points and your percentage of points out of all possible will be available to you throughout the semester. 

For your final grade, I guarantee an A to all students with at least 90% of all possible points, a B to all students with points between 80-89%, and a C to all students with point between 70-79%. Depending upon the way the grading actually works out, I reserve the right to adjust the percentages downward (so, for example, it may turn out that 88% could be enough for an A), but I will never adjust the percentages upward. Thus, it is possible for everyone in the class to receive an A if everyone in the class earns at least 90% of all points.
