  <h1 id="e09-how-do-software-engineers-contribute-to-the-good-life-for-others">E09: How do software engineers contribute to the good life for others?</h1>

<p>(Adapted with permission from “An Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics” by Shannon Vallor and Arvind Narayanan.)</p>

<p><em>Before starting this experience, please read <a href="reading-se-ethics-intro.html">What do we mean when we talk about ethics?</a>.</em></p>

<p>There is a second way in which we need to broaden our understanding of engineering
ethics. Ethics is not just about avoiding harms, as a narrow focus on preventing
catastrophic events might make us believe. Ethics is just as much about doing good.
‘Doing good’ is not something that matters only to missionaries, social workers and
philanthropists. To live a ‘good life’ is to make a positive contribution to the world
through your existence, to be able to say at the end of your life that in your short time
here, you made the world at least somewhat better than it would have been without you in
it. This is also how we think about the lives of those who have left us: when we mourn
our friends and loved ones, we comfort ourselves by remembering the unique comforts
and joys they brought to our lives, and the lives of others; we remember the creative work
they left behind, the problems they helped us solve, and the beautiful acts they performed,
great and small. Could a life about which these things could not be said still be a good life?</p>

<p>If the good life requires making a positive contribution to the world in which others live,
then it would be perverse if we accomplished none of that in our professional lives, where
we spend many or most of our waking hours, and to which we devote a large proportion
of our intellectual and creative energies. Excellent doctors contribute health and vitality
to their patients and medical knowledge to their interns and colleagues; excellent
professors cultivate knowledge, insight, skill and confidence in their students and contribute
the benefits of their research to the wider community; excellent lawyers contribute balance,
fairness and intellectual vigor to a larger system of justice.</p>

<h4 id="questions-for-discussion">Questions for discussion:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What sorts of things can excellent software engineers contribute to
the good life?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kinds of character traits, qualities, behaviors and/or habits do
you think mark the kinds of people who tend to contribute most in these ways?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which sections of the <a href="https://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> or the <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics">Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice</a> indicate the need to do good as opposed to merely avoiding harm?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
